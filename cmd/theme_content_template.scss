  THEME_NAME_HERE

  Welcome to the theme file for THEME_NAME_HERE in Pok√©Community 3. Like the New UI, you will use this file to set stylesheet configuration details for your theme. However, the exact process is a little different.

  In PC 3, we use "custom properties", aka CSS variables, rather than SASS/SCSS variables to store theme-specific config. The reason for this is a technical one to do with the limitations of React and single page apps.

  What's the difference? You may be familiar with SASS variables, which are written like so:

    $my-variable: my-value;

  CSS variables are written like this instead:

    --my-variable: my-value;

  Simple, right? Well, there's a few other differences.

  If you need to *use* a CSS variable somewhere else, instead of just writing its name like in SASS, you must use the var() function. For example, once --my-variable is declared, you can access it elsewhere using var(--my-var).

  It's worth noting that although we're not using SASS variables for configuration, you *can* still use other SASS features such as nesting and mixins.

  Another difference from PC 2.0 is that the entirety of your theme config, including any custom CSS changes, *must* be written inside the outermost .App block in this file. It should look like this:

  .App[data-theme="THEME_SLUG_HERE"] {
    // put all your code here
  }

  Make sure to *never* add rules or variables outside of that block, or you will introduce bugs with PC 3's theme system.

  Anyways, that wraps up this introduction. Have fun customizing your theme! If you have any questions, you know who to come to.
